## Intuition
The problem requires partitioning a string into as many parts as possible so that each character appears in at most one part. The key insight is that we need to track the last occurrence of each character to determine the boundaries of our partitions. When we reach the last occurrence of all characters in our current partition, we can create a new partition.

## Approach
1. Create an array to store the last occurrence index of each character in the string
2. Use two pointers to track partition boundaries:
   - `left`: marks the start of current partition
   - `right`: marks the farthest position we need to include in current partition
3. Iterate through the string:
   - Update `right` to be the maximum of current `right` and last occurrence of current character
   - When we reach `right`, we've found a complete partition
   - Add partition size to result and start a new partition

## Code
```typescript
function partitionLabels(s: string): number[] {
    const result: number[] = []; // Array to store the sizes of the partitions
    const lastOccurrence: number[] = new Array(26).fill(0); // Array to track last occurrences of characters

    // Store the last occurrence index of each character
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        lastOccurrence[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97] = i; // Convert character to index (a=0, b=1, ..., z=25)
    }

    let left = 0; // Left boundary of the current partition
    let right = 0; // Right boundary of the current partition

    // Iterate through the string to determine partition boundaries
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        right = Math.max(right, lastOccurrence[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97]); // Update right boundary

        // If i reaches the end of the current partition
        if (i === right) {
            result.push(right - left + 1); // Add partition size to result
            left = right + 1; // Update left for the next partition
        }
    }

    return result; // Return the array of partition sizes
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - n: length of the string
  - We make two passes through the string:
    1. First pass to record last occurrences
    2. Second pass to determine partitions

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a fixed-size array of size 26 for storing last occurrences
  - The result array's size depends on the number of partitions but doesn't affect space complexity classification

The solution efficiently partitions the string by tracking character occurrences and using two pointers to determine partition boundaries.
