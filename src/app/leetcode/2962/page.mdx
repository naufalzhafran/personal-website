## Intuition

This problem asks us to count subarrays where the maximum element of the array appears at least k times. My initial intuition was to use a sliding window approach.

The key insight is that we only need to track occurrences of the maximum element in the array, as this is what determines whether a subarray meets our criteria. By using a sliding window technique, we can efficiently count valid subarrays without examining every possible subarray individually.

## Approach

1. Find the maximum element in the array (`max_element`):
   - First, we scan the array to identify the largest value

2. Set up a sliding window using two pointers:
   - `start`: the left boundary of our window
   - `end`: the right boundary of our window, which we'll iterate through the array
   - `max_elements_in_window`: counter tracking occurrences of `max_element` in current window

3. Process each element in the array sequentially:
   - When we encounter the maximum element, increment `max_elements_in_window`
   - When `max_elements_in_window` reaches exactly `k`, shrink the window from the left until we have `k-1` occurrences
   - For each window position, add `start` to our answer (representing valid subarrays)

4. The counting technique is the key insight:
   - When we've found exactly `k` occurrences and shrink the window, the value of `start` represents how many valid subarrays end at the current position
   - This allows us to count all valid subarrays without explicitly generating each one

5. Return the final count as our answer

## Solution Code

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Find the maximum element in the array
        max_element = max(nums)
        
        # Initialize variables:
        # ans - final count of valid subarrays
        # start - left boundary of our sliding window
        # max_elements_in_window - count of maximum elements in current window
        ans = start = max_elements_in_window = 0

        # Iterate through the array with 'end' as the right boundary of our window
        for end in range(len(nums)):
            # If current element is the maximum element, increment our counter
            if nums[end] == max_element:
                max_elements_in_window += 1
            
            # If we have exactly k occurrences of max element, shrink window from left
            # until we have k-1 occurrences
            while max_elements_in_window == k:
                # If element at 'start' is the maximum element, decrement our counter
                if nums[start] == max_element:
                    max_elements_in_window -= 1
                # Move the left boundary of our window
                start += 1
            
            # For the current end position, all subarrays starting from 0 to 'start-1'
            # and ending at 'end' will have less than k occurrences of max_element,
            # which means all subarrays starting from 'start' or later to 'end'
            # will have at least k occurrences
            ans += start
        
        return ans
```

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We first find the maximum element which takes O(n) time
  - Then we use a sliding window which processes each element at most twice (once when it enters the window, once when it exits)
  - Overall, the solution has linear time complexity

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a few variables regardless of input size
  - No additional data structures are needed that scale with input size

The sliding window approach is particularly efficient for this problem because it allows us to avoid generating all possible subarrays explicitly, which would lead to an O(nÂ²) solution. Instead, we process each element at most twice, resulting in an O(n) solution.
