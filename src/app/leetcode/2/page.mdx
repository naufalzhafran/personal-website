## Intuition

This is a simple addition problem, but it's implemented on linked lists. We need to add the numbers from the two lists together and return the result as a linked list. We will follow the same approach as we would do addition on paper. We will iterate through the two lists, adding the numbers together and carrying over the carry to the next digit.

## Approach

The solution is straightforward. We will iterate through the two lists and handle all the edge cases.

1. Initialize the result list and a pointer to its head.
2. While loop until both lists are exhausted and there is no carry left:
    - Add the values of the two pointed nodes and the carry
    - Update the carry from the sum
    - Create a new node with the sum value and append it to the result list
    - Move all of the pointers to the next node
3. Return the result list

## Solution Code

```python
def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    carry = 0
    result = ListNode()  # This will be a dummy head
    head = result

    while l1 is not None or l2 is not None or carry:
        sum_val = 0
        if l1 is not None:
            sum_val += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2 is not None:
            sum_val += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        
        sum_val += carry
        carry = sum_val // 10  # Integer division for the carry
        head.next = ListNode(sum_val % 10)
        head = head.next

    return result.next  # Return the actual head of the result list (skip the dummy head)
```

## Time & Space Complexity


- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through the two lists once, so the time complexity is O(n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We create a new node for each digit in the result list, so the space complexity is O(n)
