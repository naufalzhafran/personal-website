## Intuition
The problem involves solving questions in an exam where each question has a certain number of points and a brainpower cost. If you solve a question, you earn points but cannot solve the next brainpower number of questions. The goal is to maximize the total points earned.

The key challenge is to decide whether to solve each question or skip it, based on the points and brainpower constraints. This decision-making process can be efficiently handled using dynamic programming.

## Approach
1. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points that can be earned starting from each question
   - Break down the problem into simpler subproblems and store results to avoid redundant calculations

2. **Reverse Iteration**
   - Iterate through the questions in reverse order
   - Build the solution from the last question to the first
   - Makes it easier to decide whether to solve or skip each question based on subsequent results

3. **Decision Making**
   For each question, we have two choices:
   - Solve the question: Earn the points but skip the next brainpower questions
   - Skip the question: Move to the next question without earning points
   - Calculate maximum points for each choice and store in dp array

## Code
```typescript
function mostPoints(questions: number[][]): number {
    // Initialize a dp array to store the maximum points starting from each question
    const dp = new Array<number>(questions.length).fill(0);

    // Iterate through the questions in reverse order
    for (let i = questions.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const [points, brainpower] = questions[i];

        // Points if we skip the current question
        const skipPoints = dp[i + 1] ?? 0;

        // Points if we solve the current question
        const solvePoints = points + (dp[i + brainpower + 1] ?? 0);

        // Store the maximum points we can earn starting from the current question
        dp[i] = Math.max(skipPoints, solvePoints);
    }

    // The result is the maximum points starting from the first question
    return dp[0];
}
```

## Time & Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Where n is the number of questions
  - We iterate through the questions array once

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Due to the dp array that stores maximum points for each question
  - The array size is equal to the number of questions

This approach efficiently solves the problem using dynamic programming, ensuring that we make optimal decisions at each step to maximize the total points earned.
