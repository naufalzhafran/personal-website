## Intuition

The 3Sum problem asks us to find all unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero. The brute-force approach would be to check every possible triplet, but this is inefficient for large arrays. The key insight is that by sorting the array, we can use a two-pointer technique to efficiently find pairs that, together with a fixed element, sum to zero. Sorting also helps us easily skip duplicates, ensuring unique triplets in the result.

## Approach

1. **Sort the array** to make it easier to find triplets and skip duplicates.
2. **Loop through each number** in the array, treating it as the first number of a potential triplet.
3. For each number, use **two pointers** (one starting just after the current number, one at the end) to find two other numbers that, together with the current number, sum to zero.
4. **Skip duplicates** to ensure all triplets are unique.
5. Add each valid triplet to the result list.

## Solution Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()  # Sort the numbers
        result = []  # Store the triplets

        # Loop through each number to fix the first element
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Skip duplicate first elements
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue

            # Set up two pointers for the rest of the array
            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1

            # Find the other two elements using two pointers
            while left < right:
                current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

                if current_sum < 0:
                    left += 1  # Need a larger sum, move left pointer right
                elif current_sum > 0:
                    right -= 1 # Need a smaller sum, move right pointer left
                else:
                    # Found a triplet that sums to zero
                    result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])

                    left += 1  # Move left pointer right to find next unique triplet
                    # Skip duplicate second elements
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left - 1]:
                        left += 1

        return result
```

**Explanation:**
- We sort the array to make it easier to skip duplicates and use two pointers.
- For each number, we use two pointers to find pairs that sum to the negative of the fixed number.
- We skip duplicates for both the fixed number and the left pointer to ensure unique triplets.
- The result is a list of all unique triplets that sum to zero.

## Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
  - The main loop runs O(n) times, and for each iteration, the two-pointer scan takes O(n) in the worst case.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (excluding the output)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space for variables and pointers.
  - The output list does not count towards space complexity as per LeetCode conventions.

**Why?**
- Sorting is O(n log n), but dominated by the O(n^2) two-pointer search.
- No extra data structures are used except for the output list.
